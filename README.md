# Thermal Simulation
This program simulates water flowing through pipe being warmed by solar radiation, pressurized by a pump, and cooled,  
in a tank,back to its initial temperature.in a tank. There are many dangerous assumptions made in the simulation, but 
as it is just a way to showcase some of my know-how I left them in.  

- This simulation is a **steady state system**.  It does not simluate any transient periods. 
- All pipe sections are evaluated as fully developed 
- Minor Losses are ignored
- 

## Solar Heating
- Heat flux is constant around the surface area of the pipe pipe, and 100% of the solar radiation is absorbed. 
## Pump

## Tank
 - Make tank a varible distance about
